# Projects for Web Development

This is my projects for my Web Development Class. There are 3 Projects.


## Project 1

This project is a To-Do App that uses Interact.js, a new javascript library I haven't used yet. 

### Blog

My project is a to-do app, and there are many out there so I first googled to-do list app designs and ideas to get a sense of what has already been done. 
I really liked this design:

I liked how simple and easy to understand it was, and how the colors were used. 

Getting started was decently easy, I knew I wanted a title, and then the list, and then an add task button so I set up my html with these, and started with an empty list that the javascript will append to

In my javascript, I first listed out some functions I knew I wanted, like creating a task list item, adding a task, deleting a task

I just made my basic list that can add and delete items and started to mess around with tailwind css. I have never used it so it was a very slow start but I used a ton of documentation and got it to look decently how I wanted.

I then added my interact js and started by copy pasting from the documentation and filling in my ids and classes to the draggable model. It worked well for the most part, and I messed around with the inertia feature. 

I wanted my items to click into place in the list so they can be reordered so I added a dropzone using the documentation and set it to my list div. It has worked somewhat and I can reorder some, but only moving items down the list. Up hasnâ€™t worked yet, that is this week's goal. 

So far I have stuck with the defaults for tailwind, but I want to add my own colors and typography to my design so it is more unique. I would like to also add some background designs like the inspiration I found.

I had a cool idea that instead of a delete button on each task, I could make a trash can in a corner and the items can be dragged there to be deleted. I need to look more into interact js to see how to do this.

This is my design so far:
